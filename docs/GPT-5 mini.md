I'll read the key files now to form a focused analysis: ThemeProvider.tsx, ThemeRibbon.tsx, ThemeSwitcher.tsx, and UIShowcase.tsx. This will confirm integration points and missing features. I expect to extract the current API, props, and where to add persistence and customizer components.

Read ThemeProvider.tsx

Read ThemeRibbon.tsx

Read ThemeSwitcher.tsx

Read UIShowcase.tsx

Starting (2/5) Identify missing features

Starting (3/5) Map features to files

Progress update: I inspected ThemeProvider.tsx, ThemeRibbon.tsx, ThemeSwitcher.tsx, and UIShowcase.tsx. Observations:

ThemeProvider currently initializes with LightTheme and applies theme values as CSS variables on document.documentElement. It does not persist theme or accept an initial theme prop.
ThemeRibbon is a presentational component that expects themes, selectedTheme, and onSelect. It does not use the theme context directly.
ThemeSwitcher imports all theme options and sets the theme via UseTheme().setTheme. It uses select box UI.
UIShowcase has placeholder layout; the navigation split is commented out.
Next I'll finish mapping missing features to files and present a prioritized implementation plan. Then, if you want, I can implement a small, low-risk improvement (theme persistence) and run quick verification.

I'll now produce the mapped file suggestions and a prioritized plan. I'll map missing features to exact files and give a prioritized plan, then propose a small, safe implementation you can accept (persist theme to localStorage). If you want me to implement it now, say "Implement persistence" and I'll make the change and verify it.

Quick summary of findings (from inspected files)
ThemeProvider.tsx applies theme as CSS variables but:
Doesn't accept an initial theme prop.
Does not persist theme selection.
ThemeSwitcher.tsx is functional and calls setTheme.
ThemeRibbon.tsx is presentational and expects props; it doesn't read context directly.
UIShowcase.tsx is mostly placeholder; split navigation is commented out.
Missing features (mapped to files)
Live Theme Customizer: add src/components/ThemeCustomizer.tsx.
Theme Persistence (localStorage): modify ThemeProvider.tsx.
Allow initial theme prop + dynamic loading: update ThemeProvider.tsx to accept theme?: ITheme.
Dark/Light mode variants: update theme option files under src/themes/options/_ and add toggle in ThemeSwitcher.tsx.
Theme import/export (JSON): add src/components/ThemeImportExport.tsx.
Theme registry auto-discovery: create src/themes/index.ts to export themes programmatically used by ThemeSwitcher and ThemeRibbon.
Accessibility improvements: audit src/components/_ and add ARIA attributes.
Component states in showcase: update UIShowcase.tsx to render variants.
Animations for smooth theme switch: ThemeProvider.tsx and CSS in theme.css.
Tests: add src/**tests**/theme.test.tsx.
Docs: add src/docs/Theming.md or docs/theming.md.
Prioritized implementation plan (high → low)
Theme Persistence & initial load (low risk) — ThemeProvider.tsx.
Theme registry & auto-discovery — src/themes/index.ts.
ThemeSwitcher + Ribbon integration (use context & registry) — ThemeSwitcher.tsx, ThemeRibbon.tsx.
UIShowcase: add component state demos — UIShowcase.tsx.
Theme Customizer (live editing) — src/components/ThemeCustomizer.tsx.
Import/Export themes — src/components/ThemeImportExport.tsx.
Dark/Light mode refinements — theme files + ThemeSwitcher.
Accessibility + responsive polish — components + CSS.
Tests and docs.
Suggested small, safe change to implement now
Persist selected theme to localStorage in ThemeProvider.tsx and load it on init. This is low-risk, easy to verify, and improves UX immediately.
If you want this implemented now, reply "Implement persistence" and I'll apply the code changes and run the quick checks.
